2. Enter text or use default sample text
3. Select voice (F1, F2, M1, M2)
4. Adjust settings:

   * **Speed:** 0.5x (slow) – 2.0x (fast)
   * **Denoising steps:** 1–20 (higher = better quality, slower)

---

## Voice Styles

* **F1** – Clear female voice, neutral tone
* **F2** – Softer female voice, warm tone

* **Medium text (150 characters):** 5–10 seconds
* **Long text (300 characters):** 10–15 seconds

**Optimization Tips**

* Faster generation: fewer denoising steps (2–3), higher speed (1.3–1.5x), shorter text
* Better quality: moderate speed (1.0x), higher denoising steps (8–10), proper punctuation
