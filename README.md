* Better quality: moderate speed (1.0x), higher denoising steps (8–10), proper punctuation

## Included Models

All models are bundled within the APK with selective int8 quantization (~250–300 MB):

| Model              | Size (Quantized) |
| ------------------ | ---------------- |
| Duration Predictor | ~1.5 MB          |
| Text Encoder       | ~20 MB           |
| Vector Estimator   | ~90 MB           |
| Vocoder            | ~70 MB           |

Voice configuration files:

**Model Optimization:** Models use selective int8 quantization (MatMul operations only) to reduce size while maintaining audio quality.
